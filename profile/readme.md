# Vatox Global Multi-Media PLC
#### The initial (and temporary) space to collaborate, update and work on projects under the VGMM PLC or Team Vatox umbrella. All projects, git repositories and teams will be moved to V-PORTAL upon completion.

### Firstly, the ground rules:
1. Blocks of code (Functions, Classes / Objects and/or single lines) must be commented with the purpose to avoid confusion when collaborating.
2. Projects created under Vatox will remain under Vatox unless stated otherwise by management or in a contract / pre admission agreement.
3. Projects not explicitly stated to be under Vatox will stay in the creators possesion upon the event of them leaving or a termination of relationship.

### Secondly, the languages: Please try to stay within this list of languages, in order to avoid confusion or language barriers.
1. For web apps, avoid PHP and instead use JavaScript forms / libraries, and for frameworks, please stick to VueJS, ExpressJS and / or PugJS
2. For databases, please use PostregeSQL or MySQL for online databases, SQLite3 for memory and local containing secure information, and JSON for none sensetive information stored locally.
3. For None web applications (Mobile / Desktop, etc), please use C based languages for low-level programming and VueJS for applications running web-based code.
#### Projects outside of this language list will be automatically rejected, but you may appeal this decision by requesting an addition to the list via management.

### Finally, the repository rules:
1. Please clearly name and describe the repository in the provided spaces whilst setting up.
2. You must license the project appropriately and have a .gitignore file catered for the style of project.
3. A readme.md file must be included, clearly titling and subtitling, with setup instructions, team members and roles clearly stated.
4. Regular commits must be made, unless the repository is currently marked as inactive. Commits must be clearly described and accurately titled.

#### We will not be implementing a 'punishment' or 'Consequence' system as at Team Vatox, we believe in equality across all roles. Repeated offences may be raised to management and a vote will be held to decide futher actions.

Thank you for your contributions, <br/>
